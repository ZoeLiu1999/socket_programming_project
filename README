** Project Overview **
This project implements a book management system with features for both users and administrators. Users can check out books by entering the correct book code after logging in. Administrators have the ability to review the inventory of a specific book after logging in with the username "admin" and password "Admin." The client and the main server communicate using TCP, while the main server communicates with backend servers using UDP.


**client.cpp**
This code file communicates with the user and establishes a TCP connection with the Main server.

**serverM.cpp**
This code file processes the client's commands, including authentication commands and book query commands. To process the book query command, it communicates with the backend servers through UDP. Meanwhile, it communicates with the client through TCP.

**serverS.cpp**
This code file processes the book query for the Science Library. It receives queries from the Main server and sends back results through UDP.

**serverL.cpp**
This code file processes the book query for the Literature Library. It receives queries from the Main server and sends back results through UDP.

**serverH.cpp**
This code file processes the book query for the History Library. It receives queries from the Main server and sends back results through UDP.

**Format of On-Screen Message and Message Exchanged**
The printed messages strictly follow the ON SCREEN MESSAGES TABLE. Usernames and passwords are encoded as len(username) + len(password) + username + password when sent from client.cpp to serverM.cpp as a char*. Book codes are encoded as length + bookcode + user identity. All reply messages are integers.

**Idiosyncrasy**
Book codes must start with a capital letter.

**Reused Code**
All the socket initialization codes are copied from Beej's tutorial. All the copied codes have comments above indicating they are copied. The code for finding the local port number is inspired by the hints in the assignment guide.
